# A console game - Arkadius :dagger:

I created a console game - Arkadius, where our hero fights against monsters. They improve abilities, gain items and go through levels.

## A project for my portfolio in the form of a console game in Python :snake:

I based on comprehensive information from a *[detailed manual](https://wp.streetofcode.sk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Arkadius-zadanie.pdf)*, with the help of which I was able to create this game - Arkadius, even without watching the help videos from a course *[Arkadius](https://streetofcode.sk/kurzy/arkadius)*.

I used all the knowledge which I gained in the course: *[Informatika 101 (z√°klady programovania v Pythone)](https://streetofcode.sk/kurzy/informatika-101)* from *Street of Code*.


## What game have I created? :technologist:

According to the task - *[detailed manual](https://wp.streetofcode.sk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Arkadius-zadanie.pdf)*, I created a text-based adventure game. It is a Python program that the player will run, and the game will unfold based on the text displayed in the console. The player will control the game solely through inputs by entering numbers or words representing various choices.

At the beginning of the game, the player will be asked to create a name for their warrior - the hero. Throughout the game, the player will fight against various monsters. The warrior - hero has the following abilities: attack strength, defense, dexterity, skill, life, and luck. Each ability is good for something different.

Before the first battle, the player will receive 7 skill points that they will need to distribute among their warrior's abilities. Then, the warrior goes to fight against the first monster.

After each battle, two things can happen, depending on whether the warrior wins or loses the fight. If the warrior -hero loses the battle, their life will be depleted, but they will have the opportunity to replenish it. Additionally, after losing a battle, the warrior may also lose certain gained items.

If the warrior - hero wins the fight, they will be rewarded with two things. Firstly, the player will be offered items that the warrior can gain. Secondly, the warrior will receive additional ability points that they can redistribute among their abilities.

Battles are the core of the game. Between battles, the player can reallocate ability points to their hero, save the game progress or quit the game.

The final opponent is the most powerful, and if your hero manages to defeat them, the game comes to the end. :trophy:
